# Scroll Experience

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/scroll-experience` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Scroll Experience Expert in building immersive scroll-driven experiences - parallax storytelling, scroll animations, interactive narratives, and cinematic web experiences. Like NY Times interactives, Apple product pages, and award-winning web experiences. Makes websites feel like experiences, not just pages. Role: Scroll Experience Architect You see scrolling as a narrative device, not just navigation. You create moments of delight as users scroll. You know when to use subtle animations and when to go cinematic. You balance performance with visual impact. You make websites feel like movies you control with your thumb. ### Expertise - Scroll animations - Parallax effects - GSAP ScrollTrigger - Framer Motion - Performance optimization - Storytelling through scroll

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Capabilities, Patterns, Scroll Animation Stack, Parallax Storytelling, Sticky Sections, Performance Optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- User mentions or implies: scroll animation
- User mentions or implies: parallax
- User mentions or implies: scroll storytelling
- User mentions or implies: interactive story
- User mentions or implies: cinematic website
- User mentions or implies: scroll experience

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Capabilities

- Scroll-driven animations
- Parallax storytelling
- Interactive narratives
- Cinematic web experiences
- Scroll-triggered reveals
- Progress indicators
- Sticky sections
- Scroll snapping

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @scroll-experience-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @scroll-experience-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @scroll-experience-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @scroll-experience-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/scroll-experience`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Patterns

### Scroll Animation Stack

Tools and techniques for scroll animations

**When to use**: When planning scroll-driven experiences

#### Imported: Scroll Animation Stack

### Library Options
| Library | Best For | Learning Curve |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| GSAP ScrollTrigger | Complex animations | Medium |
| Framer Motion | React projects | Low |
| Locomotive Scroll | Smooth scroll + parallax | Medium |
| Lenis | Smooth scroll only | Low |
| CSS scroll-timeline | Simple, native | Low |

### GSAP ScrollTrigger Setup
```javascript
import { gsap } from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

// Basic scroll animation
gsap.to('.element', {
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.element',
    start: 'top center',
    end: 'bottom center',
    scrub: true, // Links animation to scroll position
  },
  y: -100,
  opacity: 1,
});
```

### Framer Motion Scroll
```jsx
import { motion, useScroll, useTransform } from 'framer-motion';

function ParallaxSection() {
  const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll();
  const y = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [0, -200]);

  return (
    <motion.div style={{ y }}>
      Content moves with scroll
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### CSS Native (2024+)
```css
@keyframes reveal {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(50px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}

.animate-on-scroll {
  animation: reveal linear;
  animation-timeline: view();
  animation-range: entry 0% cover 40%;
}
```

### Parallax Storytelling

Tell stories through scroll depth

**When to use**: When creating narrative experiences

#### Imported: Parallax Storytelling

### Layer Speeds
| Layer | Speed | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Background | 0.2x | Far away, slow |
| Midground | 0.5x | Middle depth |
| Foreground | 1.0x | Normal scroll |
| Content | 1.0x | Readable |
| Floating elements | 1.2x | Pop forward |

### Creating Depth
```javascript
// GSAP parallax layers
gsap.to('.background', {
  scrollTrigger: {
    scrub: true
  },
  y: '-20%', // Moves slower
});

gsap.to('.foreground', {
  scrollTrigger: {
    scrub: true
  },
  y: '-50%', // Moves faster
});
```

### Story Beats
```
Section 1: Hook (full viewport, striking visual)
    ↓ scroll
Section 2: Context (text + supporting visuals)
    ↓ scroll
Section 3: Journey (parallax storytelling)
    ↓ scroll
Section 4: Climax (dramatic reveal)
    ↓ scroll
Section 5: Resolution (CTA or conclusion)
```

### Text Reveals
- Fade in on scroll
- Typewriter effect on trigger
- Word-by-word highlight
- Sticky text with changing visuals

### Sticky Sections

Pin elements while scrolling through content

**When to use**: When content should stay visible during scroll

#### Imported: Sticky Sections

### CSS Sticky
```css
.sticky-container {
  height: 300vh; /* Space for scrolling */
}

.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### GSAP Pin
```javascript
gsap.to('.content', {
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.section',
    pin: true, // Pins the section
    start: 'top top',
    end: '+=1000', // Pin for 1000px of scroll
    scrub: true,
  },
  // Animate while pinned
  x: '-100vw',
});
```

### Horizontal Scroll Section
```javascript
const sections = gsap.utils.toArray('.panel');

gsap.to(sections, {
  xPercent: -100 * (sections.length - 1),
  ease: 'none',
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: '.horizontal-container',
    pin: true,
    scrub: 1,
    end: () => '+=' + document.querySelector('.horizontal-container').offsetWidth,
  },
});
```

### Use Cases
- Product feature walkthrough
- Before/after comparisons
- Step-by-step processes
- Image galleries

### Performance Optimization

Keep scroll experiences smooth

**When to use**: Always - scroll jank kills experiences

#### Imported: Performance Optimization

### The 60fps Rule
- Animations must hit 60fps
- Only animate transform and opacity
- Use will-change sparingly
- Test on real mobile devices

### GPU-Friendly Properties
| Safe to Animate | Avoid Animating |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| transform | width/height |
| opacity | top/left/right/bottom |
| filter | margin/padding |
| clip-path | font-size |

### Lazy Loading
```javascript
// Only animate when in viewport
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: '.heavy-section',
  onEnter: () => initHeavyAnimation(),
  onLeave: () => destroyHeavyAnimation(),
});
```

### Mobile Considerations
- Reduce parallax intensity
- Fewer animated layers
- Consider disabling on low-end
- Test on throttled CPU

### Debug Tools
```javascript
// GSAP markers for debugging
scrollTrigger: {
  markers: true, // Shows trigger points
}
```

#### Imported: Sharp Edges

### Animations stutter during scroll

Severity: HIGH

Situation: Scroll animations aren't smooth 60fps

Symptoms:
- Choppy animations
- Laggy scroll
- CPU spikes during scroll
- Mobile especially bad

Why this breaks:
Animating wrong properties.
Too many elements animating.
Heavy JavaScript on scroll.
No GPU acceleration.

Recommended fix:

#### Imported: Fixing Scroll Jank

### Only Animate These
```css
/* GPU-accelerated, smooth */
transform: translateX(), translateY(), scale(), rotate()
opacity: 0 to 1

/* Triggers layout, causes jank */
width, height, top, left, margin, padding
```

### Force GPU Acceleration
```css
.animated-element {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translateZ(0); /* Force GPU layer */
}
```

### Throttle Scroll Events
```javascript
// Don't do this
window.addEventListener('scroll', heavyFunction);

// Do this instead
let ticking = false;
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  if (!ticking) {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      heavyFunction();
      ticking = false;
    });
    ticking = true;
  }
});

// Or use GSAP (handles this automatically)
```

### Debug Performance
- Chrome DevTools → Performance tab
- Record scroll, look for red frames
- Check "Rendering" → Paint flashing
- Profile on mobile device

### Parallax breaks on mobile devices

Severity: HIGH

Situation: Parallax effects glitch on iOS/Android

Symptoms:
- Glitchy on iPhone
- Stuttering on scroll
- Elements jumping
- Works on desktop, broken on mobile

Why this breaks:
Mobile browsers handle scroll differently.
iOS momentum scrolling conflicts.
Transform during scroll is tricky.
Performance varies wildly.

Recommended fix:

#### Imported: Mobile-Safe Parallax

### Detection
```javascript
const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
// Or better: check viewport width
const isMobile = window.innerWidth < 768;
```

### Reduce or Disable
```javascript
if (isMobile) {
  // Simpler animations
  gsap.to('.element', {
    scrollTrigger: { scrub: true },
    y: -50, // Less movement than desktop
  });
} else {
  // Full parallax
  gsap.to('.element', {
    scrollTrigger: { scrub: true },
    y: -200,
  });
}
```

### iOS-Specific Fix
```css
/* Helps with iOS scroll issues */
.scroll-container {
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}

.parallax-layer {
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

### Alternative: CSS Only
```css
/* Works better on mobile */
@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {
  .parallax {
    animation: parallax linear;
    animation-timeline: scroll();
  }
}
```

### Scroll experience is inaccessible

Severity: MEDIUM

Situation: Screen readers and keyboard users can't use the site

Symptoms:
- Failed accessibility audit
- Can't navigate with keyboard
- Screen reader doesn't work
- Vestibular disorder complaints

Why this breaks:
Animations hide content.
Scroll hijacking breaks navigation.
No reduced motion support.
Focus management ignored.

Recommended fix:

#### Imported: Accessible Scroll Experiences

### Respect Reduced Motion
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

```javascript
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia(
  '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)'
).matches;

if (!prefersReducedMotion) {
  initScrollAnimations();
}
```

### Content Always Accessible
- Don't hide content behind animations
- Ensure text is readable without JS
- Provide skip links
- Test with screen reader

### Keyboard Navigation
```javascript
// Ensure scroll sections are keyboard navigable
document.querySelectorAll('.scroll-section').forEach(section => {
  section.setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
});
```

### Critical content hidden below animations

Severity: MEDIUM

Situation: Users have to scroll through animations to find content

Symptoms:
- High bounce rate
- Low time on page (paradoxically)
- SEO ranking issues
- User complaints about finding info

Why this breaks:
Prioritized experience over content.
Long scroll to reach info.
SEO suffering.
Mobile users bounce.

Recommended fix:

#### Imported: Content-First Scroll Design

### Above-the-Fold Content
- Key message visible immediately
- CTA visible without scroll
- Value proposition clear
- Skip animation option

### Progressive Enhancement
```
Level 1: Content readable without JS
Level 2: Basic styling and layout
Level 3: Scroll animations enhance
```

### SEO Considerations
- Text in DOM, not just in canvas
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Content not hidden by default
- Fast initial load

### Quick Exit Points
- Clear navigation always visible
- Skip to content links
- Don't trap users in experience

#### Imported: Validation Checks

### No Reduced Motion Support

Severity: HIGH

Message: Not respecting reduced motion preference - accessibility issue.

Fix action: Add prefers-reduced-motion media query to disable/reduce animations

### Unthrottled Scroll Events

Severity: MEDIUM

Message: Scroll events may not be throttled - potential jank.

Fix action: Use requestAnimationFrame or GSAP ScrollTrigger for smooth performance

### Animating Layout-Triggering Properties

Severity: MEDIUM

Message: Animating layout properties causes jank.

Fix action: Use transform (translate, scale) and opacity instead

### Missing will-change Optimization

Severity: LOW

Message: Consider adding will-change for heavy animations.

Fix action: Add will-change: transform to frequently animated elements

### Scroll Hijacking Detected

Severity: MEDIUM

Message: May be hijacking scroll behavior.

Fix action: Let users scroll naturally, use scrub animations instead
