# Web quality audit

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(quality)/web-quality-audit` from `https://github.com/tech-leads-club/agent-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Web quality audit Comprehensive quality review based on Google Lighthouse audits. Covers Performance, Accessibility, SEO, and Best Practices across 150+ checks.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: How it works, Audit categories, Severity levels, Audit output format, Audit results, Quick checklist.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Comprehensive web quality audit covering performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices in a single review. Use when asked to "audit my site", "review web quality", "run lighthouse audit", "check page quality", or....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when copied upstream references, examples, or scripts materially improve the answer.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `scripts/analyze.sh` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `scripts/analyze.sh` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: How it works

1. Analyze the provided code/project for quality issues
2. Categorize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Provide specific, actionable recommendations
4. Include code examples for fixes

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @web-quality-audit to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @web-quality-audit against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @web-quality-audit for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @web-quality-audit using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(quality)/web-quality-audit`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Audit categories

### Performance (40% of typical issues)

**Core Web Vitals** — Must pass for good page experience:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s.** The largest visible element must render quickly. Optimize images, fonts, and server response time.
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint) < 200ms.** User interactions must feel instant. Reduce JavaScript execution time and break up long tasks.
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1.** Content must not jump around. Set explicit dimensions on images, embeds, and ads.

**Resource Optimization:**

- **Compress images.** Use WebP/AVIF with fallbacks. Serve correctly sized images via `srcset`.
- **Minimize JavaScript.** Remove unused code. Use code splitting. Defer non-critical scripts.
- **Optimize CSS.** Extract critical CSS. Remove unused styles. Avoid `@import`.
- **Efficient fonts.** Use `font-display: swap`. Preload critical fonts. Subset to needed characters.

**Loading Strategy:**

- **Preconnect to origins.** Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for third-party domains.
- **Preload critical assets.** LCP images, fonts, and above-fold CSS.
- **Lazy load below-fold content.** Images, iframes, and heavy components.
- **Cache effectively.** Long cache TTLs for static assets. Immutable caching for hashed files.

### Accessibility (30% of typical issues)

**Perceivable:**

- **Text alternatives.** Every `<img>` has meaningful `alt` text. Decorative images use `alt=""`.
- **Color contrast.** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA).
- **Don't rely on color alone.** Use icons, patterns, or text alongside color indicators.
- **Captions and transcripts.** Video has captions. Audio has transcripts.

**Operable:**

- **Keyboard accessible.** All functionality available via keyboard. No keyboard traps.
- **Focus visible.** Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements.
- **Skip links.** Provide "Skip to main content" for keyboard users.
- **Sufficient time.** Users can extend time limits. No auto-advancing content without controls.

**Understandable:**

- **Page language.** Set `lang` attribute on `<html>`.
- **Consistent navigation.** Same navigation structure across pages.
- **Error identification.** Form errors clearly described and associated with fields.
- **Labels and instructions.** All form inputs have associated labels.

**Robust:**

- **Valid HTML.** No duplicate IDs. Properly nested elements.
- **ARIA used correctly.** Prefer native elements. ARIA roles match behavior.
- **Name, role, value.** Interactive elements have accessible names and correct roles.

### SEO (15% of typical issues)

**Crawlability:**

- **Valid robots.txt.** Doesn't block important resources.
- **XML sitemap.** Lists all important pages. Submitted to Search Console.
- **Canonical URLs.** Prevent duplicate content issues.
- **No noindex on important pages.** Check meta robots and headers.

**On-Page SEO:**

- **Unique title tags.** 50-60 characters. Primary keyword included.
- **Meta descriptions.** 150-160 characters. Compelling and unique.
- **Heading hierarchy.** Single `<h1>`. Logical heading structure.
- **Descriptive link text.** Not "click here" or "read more".

**Technical SEO:**

- **Mobile-friendly.** Responsive design. Tap targets ≥ 48px.
- **HTTPS.** Secure connection required.
- **Fast loading.** Performance directly impacts ranking.
- **Structured data.** JSON-LD for rich snippets (Article, Product, FAQ, etc.).

### Best practices (15% of typical issues)

**Security:**

- **HTTPS everywhere.** No mixed content. HSTS enabled.
- **No vulnerable libraries.** Keep dependencies updated.
- **CSP headers.** Content Security Policy to prevent XSS.
- **No exposed source maps.** In production builds.

**Modern Standards:**

- **No deprecated APIs.** Replace `document.write`, synchronous XHR, etc.
- **Valid doctype.** Use `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- **Charset declared.** `<meta charset="UTF-8">` as first element in `<head>`.
- **No browser errors.** Clean console. No CORS issues.

**UX Patterns:**

- **No intrusive interstitials.** Especially on mobile.
- **Clear permission requests.** Only ask when needed, with context.
- **No misleading buttons.** Buttons do what they say.
